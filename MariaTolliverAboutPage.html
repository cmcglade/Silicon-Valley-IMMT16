    <p> Hi there! My name is Maria and I am the content mananger for the website. Managing ideas, blogs, and swear words. I come from a film and digital media background,writing,blogging,yep all things awesome. I have a cat who also is a fan of managing content by walking on my keyboard while Im working. I am always in planning mode and have a philosophy where being on time is late and early is on time but surprisingly to most I am still easy going and unbothered in most situations. I love traveling, wining and dining going on walks,cracking jokes, and shooting the breeze. Other than that I'm a passionate writer, dreamer, star gazer, tech lover and all things nerd and creative. </p>
